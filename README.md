## 🎮 What is BattleRoyaleChain?        
      
`BattleRoyaleChain` is a fully on-chain, turn-based battle royale strategy game inspired by **Fortnite**, designed to run entirely on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Up to 10 players spawn on a shrinking 10×10 map, move, attack, and survive until only one remains.       
              
Every movement, every attack, and every zone update is stored immutably on-chain.

## 🗺️ Game Rules      
      
- 🌐 Max 10 players      
- 🟢 Game starts when 10 players join      
- 🕹️ Players take turns to `move("up")`, `move("down")`, `move("left")`, `move("right")` 
- ⚔️ Attack adjacent players with `attack(address)` 
- ☠️ Zone shrinks every 10 turns — players outside lose HP  
- 🏆 Last player standing wins (off-chain reward can be added)
